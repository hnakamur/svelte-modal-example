# Svelte modal dialog example with focus trapping

* This example is derived from [How to create a Full-Featured Modal Component in Svelte, and trap focus-within - DEV Community](https://dev.to/vibhanshu909/how-to-create-a-full-featured-modal-component-in-svelte-and-trap-focus-within-474i).
* However, the original CSS :focus-within based solution is replaced with an ECMAScript based solution which is ported from [Modal Dialog Example | WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/dialog-modal/dialog.html).
